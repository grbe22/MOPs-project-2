Assignment name is: Project 2


What did I learn?
implementation of encryption, understanding how encryption can not be undone without the key, passing references and values, scrubbing allocated memory.



What was easy/fun about this assignment?
this was such a hard assignment. understanding the idea was simple enough, but passing values and input gave me so much trouble.



What gave you problems/troubles?
handling data input and converting to blocks.



What could the instructor do to improve this assignment?
I think generally my gripe is with how hard it is to handle data. The project would be very simple if it were just a matter of taking unencrypted information and just... encrypting it / decrypting ciphertext.



What would you have liked to do in this assignment?
it'd be nice to have more control over encryption and decryption methods - like, so long as the program can encrypt & decrypt its own information the project is valid. Would've been fun just not really feasible.

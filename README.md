# MOPs-project-2
The second, and most complicated, project for MOPs 241.
Project 1 was a fun challenge - this was an aboslute nightmare. But I got it working in the end! The purpose of this project is to encode & decode text through bit shifting, among other functions.
This project wound up working well after a couple of all-nighters. Running the test cases in the original project gave me the exact desired output - something undecipherable without the key used.
